Although the inevitable happens, the courses of events lead Shri Ram re-establish Dharma. The deer is the most important animal in the Ramayan which signifies that all that glitters is not gold and one needs to be away dubious attractions.",
	"The mighty eagles, Jaytayu and Sampati also played crucial roles in the Ramayan. During Bhagwan Ram’s exile at Panchavati, Jatayu befriends him and offers all the three his protection.",
	"Off all the roles played by different animals, the contribution of the monkeys in Ramayan is outstanding. Sugriv with friendship, Hanuman with devotion and Angad with loyalty serve Bhagwan Ram. They search for Mata Sita, find her, build a bridge across the ocean, fight the mighty warriors of Lanka and help Bhagwan Ram kill Ravan get his Sita back. They prove Ravan wrong for his statement of what can mere monkeys can do. They establish the reality that no task is big if one has the determination and trust to achieve it.",
	"The wise, intellect and the gallant animals which stood with Bhagwan Ram along with the monkeys were the bears. Jambavant, the son of Brahma Ji was the most revered minister of Sugriv. Apart from killing mighty warriors of Ravan, he gives valuable counsel to Sugriv and Shri Ram during the war and guides them to victory.",
	"On the mighty ocean shores, every Vaanar is contributing in building the Ram Setu. To be a part of the mighty task, a little squirrel runs and starts collecting sand and fills the gap between the rocks. Bhagwan Ram is so very pleased with its work and he gently rubs it on his back. The black stripes on the squirrels we see today are the gentle finger strokes of Bhagwan Ram itself. The gesture of the squirrel indicates that even a small creature can contribute to success, if it has belief and the drive to achieve it.",
