	"About",
	`Crows are black birds known for their intelligence and
adaptability, and for their loud, harsh "caw." They also
have a reputation for damaging crops; however, their impact
may be less than previously thought.
The genus Corvus comprises crows, ravens and rooks. These
birds are all part of the Corvidae family, which includes
jays, magpies and nutcrackers.`,"Size",`There are about 40 species of crow, according to PBS, so
there are many different sizes of crows. The American crow
measures around 17.5 inches (45 centimeters). The fish crow
measures around 19 inches (48 cm). The common raven is much
larger and measures around 27 inches (69 cm). Crows can
weigh anywhere from 12 to 57 ounces (337 to 1,625 grams).
Rooks are smaller than crows and have distinct wedge-shaped
tails and light-colored bills. They average 18 inches (47
cm) long.
American crows differ from common ravens in several ways.
Ravens are bigger; their voices are hoarser; and they have
heavier bills, according to the University of Michigan's
Animal Diversity Web (ADW). Ravens' tails and wings come to
a point.`,"Habitate",`Crows can be found all over the world in a variety of
habitats. For example, the American crow lives all over
North America and prefers open areas — agricultural land and
grasslands — with trees nearby. They also thrive in suburban
neighborhoods, according to the ADW.
The common raven is one of the most widespread birds
worldwide, according to the ADW. They are found in northern
Europe, Scandinavia, Iceland and Greenland; throughout Asia,
from the Pacific Ocean to the Himalayas to India and Iran;
across northwestern Africa and the Canary Islands; and in
North and Central America as far south as Nicaragua. They
prefer open landscapes, too — seacoasts, treeless tundra,
rocky cliffs, mountain forests, open riverbanks, plains,
deserts and scrubby woodlands.
Rooks are found across Europe and western Asia. They, too,
prefer wide open spaces, river plains and steppes.`,"Habits",
	`Crows are extremely intelligent birds. They are known for
their problem-solving skills and amazing communication
skills. For example, when a crow encounters a mean human, it
will teach other crows how to identify the human. In fact,
research shows that crows don’t forget a face.
Many types of crows are solitary, but they will often forage
in groups. Others stay in large groups. A group of crows is
called a murder. When one crow dies, the murder will
surround the deceased. This funeral isn’t just to mourn the
dead, though. The crows gather together to find out what
killed their member. Then, the murder of crows will band
together and chase predators in a behavior called mobbing.
With some crow species, the yearlings and non-mating adults
live in a group called a roosting community.
Some crows migrate while other crows don’t migrate in the
common sense. They will travel to warmer areas of their
territory, when needed.
American crows can be harmful to crops, but they also may
prevent damage by eating insect pests, according to the ADW.
Recent studies have shown that 60 to 90 percent of insects
eaten by rooks are agricultural pests.
As foragers, they also clean up dead animals and garbage. In
fact, crows are often blamed for overturning garbage cans;
however, the real culprits are usually raccoons or dogs,
according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.`,
	"Diet",
	`Crows are omnivores, which means they eat nearly anything.
Crows eat small animals such as mammals, amphibians,
reptiles, eggs and carrion. They also eat insects, seeds,
grains, nuts, fruit, non-insect arthropods, mollusks, worms
and even other birds. Crows have also been noted eating
garbage and store food in caches, short-term, in trees or on
the ground, according to the ADW.`,"Offspring",
	`Crows are cooperative breeders, which means they often stay
close to the place where they were born and help raise and
defend the area’s young chicks. When it is time to have
offspring, a mating pair will build a nest 15 to 60 feet
(4.5 to 18 meters) above the ground using branches, twigs,
hair, twine, bark, plant fibers, mosses, cloth and other
materials. Nests are 1.5 to 2 feet (46 to 61 cm) in
diameter, according to the Washington Department of Fish and
Wildlife.
The female lays four to five eggs and incubates them for 18
days. At four weeks, the chicks are able to leave the nest,
though their parents still feed them until they are around
60 days old. Crows can live up to 14 years.`,
	"Classification/Taxonomy",
	` Here is the taxonomy of crows, according to the Integrated
Taxonomic Information System (ITIS):
Kingdom: Animalia Subkingdom: Bilateria Infrakingdom:
Deuterostomia Phylum: Chordata Subphylum: Vertebrata
Infraphylum: Gnathostomata Class: Aves Superclass: Tetrapoda
Order: Passeriformes Family: Corvidae Genus: Corvus Species:
There are more than 30, including:
Corvus brachyrhynchos (Ame
Corvus caurinus (Northwe
Corvus corax (co
Corvus corone (ca
Corvus coronoides (Austra
Corvus cryptoleucus (Chihua
Corvus florensis (F
Corvus frugil
Corvus hawaiiensis ('Alala, Haw
Corvus imparatus (Me
Corvus mellori (li
Corvus ossifragus (fish crow)`,"Conservation status",`According to the International Union for Conservation of
Nature (IUCN), most crows are not endangered. The Flores
crow is one of the exceptions. It is listed as endangered
because it has a very small population that is on the
decline as deforestation threatens its home on the
Indonesian islands of Flores and Rinca. The IUCN thinks that
its population is around 600 to 1,700 mature individuals.
The Hawaiian crow is extinct in the wild. Members of the
same genus as crows, ravens are larger birds with bigger
bills.`,"Crow Details",

	"About",
	"Cuckoo is a bird of the Cuculidae family. There are 54 species of cuckoo that can be found in the Europe, Asia, Africa and Australasia. Only 2 of 54 species live in Europe. Cuckoo inhabits open areas, such as marshes, meadows and fields, but it can be also found in woodlands and alpine areas. They are not listed as endangered, but their number in certain areas declined as a result of habitat loss, decrease in number of birds which act as foster parents to young cuckoos and because of the climate changes(which affect their migratory patterns and availability of food). ",
	"Size",
	`Cuckoos are medium-sized birds that range in size from the little bronze cuckoo, at 17 g and 15 cm (6 inches), to the channel-billed cuckoo, at 630 g (1.4 lbs) and 63 cm (25 inches).[4] There is generally little sexual dimorphism in size, but where it exists, it can be either the male or the female that is larger.`
	,"Habitate",
	`The cuckoo bird can be found pretty much anywhere with trees. They mainly inhabit deciduous and coniferous forests, woodland areas, meadows, scrubs, moorlands, lowlands and even wooded steppe. They are therefore distributed on a general scale all over the world except for Antarctica. They also refrain from dry or very cold areas like northernmost parts of North America, dry parts of Africa, the Middle East or Australia.

	Since the cuckoo depends on other birds to raise its young, they inhabit close to their hosts. There are over 100 species that the cuckoo uses as hosts. They generally choose insectivorous songbirds like warblers, wagtails, flycatchers buntings or chats. Sometimes they will also choose fruit-eating birds. This is because the cuckoo is an insectivore itself.

	Cuckoos are migratory birds. They fly south for the winter. From Europe, for example, they fly down to India, southeast Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa. The exact locations of their migration depend on their species. They generally live solitary lives (with exception to breeding season). `,

	"Offspring",
	`For the care and feeding of its offspring, the common cuckoo outsources.

	When she’s ready to lay an egg, a female Cuculus canorus swoops to the unattended nest of a smaller species. She then swallows one of the eggs that’s been laid there and lays one of her own—a behavior known as brood parasitism.
	
	Sometimes potential victims revolt. The parents that inhabit the nest may mob the cuckoo mom, preventing her from dropping off her egg; they may push out cuckoo eggs before they hatch, or they may even abandon the nest.
	
	But often the cuckoo mom gets away undetected, leaving her parental duties behind, and the nest’s owners return none the wiser.
	
	When the cuckoo chick hatches, it ejects other eggs or hatchlings to get all the space—and food—for itself. Hungry as a whole brood, the outsize baby devours everything brought by its foster parents—in the photo above, the provider is a reed warbler, a common host.`,
	"Classification/Taxonomy",
	`The species' binomial name is derived from the Latin cuculus (the cuckoo) and canorus (melodious; from canere, meaning to sing).[2][3] The cuckoo family gets its common name and genus name by onomatopoeia for the call of the male common cuckoo.[4] The English word "cuckoo" comes from the Old French cucu, and its earliest recorded usage in English is from around 1240, in the song Sumer Is Icumen In. The song is written in Middle English, and the first two lines are: "Svmer is icumen in / Lhude sing cuccu." In modern English, this translates to "Summer has come in / Loudly sing, Cuckoo!".[5]

	There are four subspecies worldwide:[6]
	
		C. c. canorus, the nominate subspecies, was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It occurs from Ireland through Scandinavia, northern Russia and Siberia to Japan in the east, and from the Pyrenees through Turkey, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, northern China and Korea. It winters in Africa and South Asia.

		C. c. bakeri, first described by Hartert in 1912, breeds in western China to the Himalayan foothills in northern India, Nepal, Myanmar, northwestern Thailand and southern China. During the winter it is found in Assam, East Bengal and southeastern Asia.

		C. c. bangsi was first described by Oberholser in 1919 and breeds in Iberia, the Balearic Islands and North Africa, spending the winter in Africa.

		C. c. subtelephonus, first described by Zarudny in 1914, breeds in Central Asia from Turkestan to southern Mongolia. It migrates to southern Asia and Africa for the winter.`,
